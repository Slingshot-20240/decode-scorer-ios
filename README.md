## Development

### Prerequisites

In order to develop the DECODE‚Ñ¢ Scorer for iOS and iPadOS, you must have the following:

- A Mac computer running macOS Sequoia (version 15) or later
- Xcode 16 or later
- The latest iOS 18 platform support and simulator runtimes
  - (Optional) iOS 17.5 platform support simulator runtimes

Here's a [guide](https://gist.github.com/JiningLiu/59ce150600c781533736b41ca0615805) to install Xcode and platform support components.

### Project Setup

To get started, clone this repository, but **DO NOT** open it in Xcode yet.

In order to accomodate code-signing requirements, this project uses an [Xcode Configuration Settings File](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/xcode/adding-a-build-configuration-file-to-your-project) for setting the target development team and product bundle identifier.

Using a text editor or IDE that is **NOT Xcode**, open [`ExampleConfig.xcconfig`](./ExampleConfig.xcconfig) and change the placeholder values for each of the two keys with your project-specific values.

- `DEVELOPMENT_TEAM` refers to your Apple Developer Program Team ID, which you can find [here](https://developer.apple.com/account#MembershipDetailsCard).
- `PRODUCT_BUNDLE_IDENTIFIER` is a unique identifier used by the system for the application. Replace with the standard convention of a reversed domain (e.g. `decode.scorer.slingshot.example.com` ‚û°Ô∏è `com.example.slingshot.scorer.decode`). This should be unique to your project, avoid using `app.ftcscoring.decode` unless you know what you are doing.

Rename [`ExampleConfig.xcconfig`](./ExampleConfig.xcconfig) to `Config.xcconfig`, and open Xcode.

In the left sidebar, navigate to `DECODE (top-level .xcodeproj) > Targets > DECODE > Build Settings > All > Development Team`, single click (select) the line, and press `delete` (`backspace`) on your keyboard. Repeat for key `Product Bundle Identifier`

You're done! Head to the `Signing & Capabilities` section on the DECODE target page to make sure your development team and bundle identifier have been set correctly.
